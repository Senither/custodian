# Custodian Template

This is the template for the Custodian project. This template is meant to provide a basic structure for the app and to help ensure that the different versions of Custodian are as similar as possible.

The template is built using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) and icons from [Heroicons](https://heroicons.dev/), if you are not familiar with these tools, you can find more information on their respective websites.

## Getting Started

To get started with the template, you can clone the repository and run the following commands within this directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start a development server. You can then access the template at `http://localhost:8080`, it will also start a live reload server on port `:9090` so you can see your changes in real-time.

Alternatively, you can just build the CSS by running `npm run build:dev` or `npm run build:prod` for development and production builds respectively.
